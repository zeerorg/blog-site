## INTRO

This is next js port of my blog which was previously in 2 repositories: [Blog Site](https://github.com/zeerorg/BlogSite) and the [Blog Posts](https://github.com/zeerorg/BlogPosts).

I rely heavily on Static Site Generation, to read the blog posts from filesystem and pre render the posts. There is zero server side rendering happening.

## Basic commands:

Start dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Generate static site and then view the site:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

The site is deployed on netlify and will auto update with master.
